- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zacharielim
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Software Engineering and Web Development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in college, majoring in Electrical Engineering but i have a passion for coding. Thus i'm trying to absorb and learn as much as i can outside of my cirriculum in hopes
to find a software related job one day.
